# web-scraping-challenge
This project's purpose was to scrape data from preexisting web pages and then displaying the scraped data using another html page. First, I performed my inital scrapping of the various websites using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter. Creating a Jupyter Notebook, I imported BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter then created variables to hold the data i had scrapped from a NASA Mars news website as well as storing the featured image of a JPL image website as a .jpeg. After that, I went on to scrape the facts out of a data table within a third url and then place them into a new datatable which was then converted into an html table string using pandas. After obtaining high resolution images of the four hemospheres of mars from a fourth Url and assigining them to a dictionary with the name of each hemisphere, I moved on to work with mongo and FlaskDB. My first task in this was to convert my jupyter notebook into a python script that would execute all the scrapping from my jupyter notebook before returning a dictionary with all the scraped data. Then I had to make a route that would import the python script and call the function in question. Finally, I had to make an html template that would display my scrapped data appropriatly.
